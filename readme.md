## Overview

This application demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem.

## Background Information
In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution. That is, suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic average of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the average will be distributed according to the normal distribution (commonly known as a "bell curve").

## Using the Application

Left Panel of this application has the various settings you can set. When you make changes to any of the settings, Main Panel will immediatly recalculate and display the results.

To demonstrate that central limit theorem applies irrespective of the type of the parent distribution, Application allows you to use choose between 5 different types of distributions. 

Make a choice between the following distributions by selecting the appropriate radio button.

* Normal
* Uniform
* Exponential
* Right Skewed
* Left Skewed

For each of these distribution, There will be couple of different parameters you can change.

Normal distribution allows you to set the Mean and the Standard Deviation.
Uniform distribition allows you to set the Lower Bound and the Upper Bound.
Exponential distribution allows you to set the Rate. 
Left and Right Skewed distributions allow you to set the level of skew (Low, Medium, High)

You can also set the sample size and the number of samples to draw from the population.

You can experiment by varying the sample size and the number of samples to different values. 

In the main panel, The first chart shows the parent distribution. Second chart shows how the sample means are distributed with a normal distribution curve overlayed on top of it.

You will see that as you increase the sample size and the number of samples, Distribution of the sample means gets closer and closer to the normal distribution.
